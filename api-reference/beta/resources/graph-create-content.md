# Create new documentation 

The following sections provide optional and required documentation steps when adding beta workload APIs:

- [Set up environment](#set-up-environment)
- [Author content](#author-content)
- [Add table of contents (TOC) entries](#add-table-of-contents-entries)
- [Add changelog entries](#add-changelog-entries)
- [Request a technical review](#request-a-technical-review)
- [Request a content review](#request-a-content-review)
- [Publish](#publish)

These actions are not necessarily done in order and may be completed by different individuals.

## Set up environment

1. **(Required if you are new to creating documentation)** Use the information in [Get started with GitHub and Microsoft Graph](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/manage-content/get-started-with-github.html) to create a Github account and get started using GitHub.
2. **(Required if you are new to creating documentation)** Choose the tools that you want to use to interact with GitHub:
    - Visual Studio Code. For more information, see [Markdown and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown). For more information about Markdown syntax, see [Docs Markdown Reference](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/markdown-reference?branch=master).
    - GitHub Windows Desktop. For more information, see [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
    - Command-line tools. For more information, see [Getting Started - The Command Line](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line).
3. **(Required)** Create a working branch in GitHub. Always add or update content through a pull request from a personal branch. Do not use the **Upload files** button on GitHub. If you are submitting a set of changes, be sure to make all your changes in a single branch and not multiple separate branches. This improves processing and publishing efficiency. Do not use a fork because it adds complexity in the content review stage. For more information, see [Contribute content to the Microsoft Graph repository](graph-manage-docs.md).

## Author content

Microsoft Graph uses CSDL (and XML format) for defining its APIs. You can use the stub generator scripts to produce stub markdown files based on the definitions in the CSDL file. Do not change the file names that are generated by the tool. Do not reorder sections in a generated topic. Do not customize generated table columns.

All of the steps in this section are required.

1. Run the stub generator scripts. For more information, see [Use the Microsoft Graph REST API docs stub generator](graph-stub-generator.md).
2. Copy the API and resource files that you created to the appropriate folders in the working branch that you created.
3. Add information to the stub files using the following guidance:
    - For resources and APIs, add [topic metadata](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/metadata.html) to be able to identify the owner of the topic, track usage, and facilitate search.
    - For resources, leave the **JSON representation** section the way it's generated by the stub generator. This section defines a resource to support API Doctor validation of examples. Do not confuse this section as an example response payload.
    - For resources and APIs, add a single-sentence summary description that describes the purpose of the resource in a concise way. If there is additional information that's no more than half a page about the resource or API, and doesn't belong to the subsequent sections that are generated, add the information to a next paragraph. The paragraph is between the summary description and the first H2 section. Do not create a Remarks section. Anything that amounts to more than half a page - extract a subject and create a separate concept topic for that information.
    - For APIs, add permissions to the table in the permissions section. Make sure that the permissions are also documented in the [Permissions reference topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference).
    - For APIs, verify/edit the HTTP request and make sure to include exactly the set of supported syntax. Add the HTTP header details (optional or required). Add any additional details regarding the HTTP request/response, as applicable.
    - For APIs, format the example response section the way that you want. 
    - For APIs, verify that the HTTP response code is what is being returned in the API.


## Add table of contents entries

It is required that you add entries in the table of contents (TOC) if you are adding new resources or APIs. Open the beta toc.yml file in the branch that you created and add TOC entries for the APIs that you are adding. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph TOC and Topic Title Guidelines](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/toc-and-topic-title.html). 

The following is a YAML example of an entry in the TOC that shows a resource and the methods that can be called on the resource:

```yaml
- name: User
  href: resources/user.md
  items:
    - name: List users
      href: api/user-list.md
    - name: Get user
      href: api/user-get.md
    - name: Create user
      href: api/user-post-users.md
    - name: Update user
      href: api/user-update.md
    - name: Delete user
      href: api/user-delete.md
```

Note that sometimes a method is relevant and exposed in more than one context in the TOC, to show the potential of Microsoft Graph. For example, a user-centric method like sendMail appears under the **Users >> Mail** node and under the **Mail >> Message** node.
Think where your documentation should appear in the TOC, and the TOC titles you want to use. Base this off the existing TOC to maintain consistency across all the content.

## Add changelog entries

It is required that you add entries in the changelog for the APIs and resources that you are adding. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph changelog guidelines](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/changelog.html).

## Request a technical review

Request a technical review of the content from those who are subject-matter experts for the APIs. The technical review generally creates several actions and changes. The review process can be time consuming; however, it is necessary to ensure technical accuracy, compliance, and completeness.

All of the steps in this section are required.

1. Create the pull request (PR). Set the label of the pull request to **do not merge**. When you receive the build verification email, you’ll be able to preview your content. For more information, see [Contribute content to the Microsoft Graph repository](graph-manage-docs.md).
2. To complete a technical review, you invite reviewers in the PR that you previously created. Reviewers can include a content developer, the developer of the API, and the PM for the workload. 

    Select **Reviewers** on the **Conversation** page of the PR, and then search for and select the reviewers that you want to include. For more information see, [Requesting a pull request review](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).

    Reviewers that want to request changes to the content can select **Request changes**. This indicates that the PR is not yet ready to merge. When the feedback has been addressed, change the review status on the PR to **Approved**. PRs should only be merged when all reviewers have set the status to **Approved**, but this may not be necessary for all PRs. For more information, see [About pull request reviews](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews).

## Request a content review

When the content has been reviewed and revised to be technically accurate, set the label to **content review**. The content review can include a content developer, but always includes the person who merges PRs. The PR is reviewed for consistency, compliance, globalization, adherence to guidelines, etc. 

After the review process is complete, incorporate any feedback that was provided in the PR. When all feedback has been incorporated, reviewers have signed off, and the APIs have been released live, set the label to **ready to merge**, and then the topics are published.

## Publish

 PRs that are ready to merge are merged before 3 PM on weekdays. All [API Doctor](graph-api-doctor.md) and OPS build validation tests must pass before merging. At or after 3 PM weekdays, all PRs that have been merged into the master branch are pulled into the live branch to publish to the site.
